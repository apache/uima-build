<!-- this POM holds common, factored-out settings for all 
     projects that are packaged as single projects
     (that is, not as multi-module projects).
     
     It builds, in addition to the standard artifacts and attachments,
     a binary artifact, which includes:
       - The main generated artifact, in the lib/ dir
       - dependent artifacts needed at runtime (not otherwise provided), in the lib/ dir
       - Lic/Not/Readme/releaseNotes from root dir 
       - generated documentation in the docs/ dir
       - other folders per the PEAR spec at the top level
         - bin folders - we set execute permissions on .sh 
     
     At release time the standard Apache parent builds the 
       - "source-release" artifact, and the
       - "javadocs" artifact
     
     Conventions:
     
       License/Notice for Jar: using the uimaj-jar-resource-bundle
       License/Notice for bin: using files from project top level
       dependencies on other artifacts: 
         Specified as scope runtime or compile causes these to be included in the lib dir
       Other top level directories per the PEAR conventions
         copied to the assembly xxx/ directory
           typically used for bin - scripts, and other binary resources
           bin - sets execution flags

  <!-- Special inheritance note
       even though the <scm> element that follows is exactly the 
       same as those in super poms, it cannot be inherited because 
       there is some special code that incorrectly computes the 
       connection elements from the chain of parent poms, if this is omitted. 
       
       Keeping this a bit factored allows cutting/pasting the <scm>
       element, and just changing the following two properties -->
